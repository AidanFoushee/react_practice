# Overview

I started this project wanting to learn about React JS and learn the basics of it.

I followed the React JS tutorial and made a tic tac toe web app.

My purpose for writing this software was too further my knowledge in the area of web apps.

# Web Pages

There is a simple 3x3 grid for playing tic tac toe. If you wish to restart the game, simply refresh the web page.

In order to run the web page on your machine, run the following commands in the termninal. 
```
cd my-app
npm start
```
The project should open in your browser.

To quit the program, go back to your terminal and press 'ctrl + c'.
